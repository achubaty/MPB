The 2015/2106 2x rise in # of endemic MPB spots at baited sites in CLAWR is matched by a rise of equal magnitude in Lac La Biche (red oval).  Other features of note in the 2016 data: (1) look at all the 2015 baited sites up at Fort Mc that burned in 2016 (little fire icons; used to be green triangles in 2015); (2) there is one baited mass attack of considerable size in LLB region (tiny orange triangle inside red oval), and this is a first; (3) the two lines of negatives on the AB-SK border are reassuring. Back in 2015 the east-most baited site was attacked.
