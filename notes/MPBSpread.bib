  abstract = {Systems for rating the susceptibility and risk of damage to lodgepole pine stands from the mountain pine beetle are described. The risk rating system considers both the susceptibility of the stand and the current threat to the stand from neighboring mountain pine beetle populations. A continuous-scale index for both risk and susceptibility can be calculated for any stand. This system provides the forest manager with a framework within which to pan and prioritize mountian pine beetle management activities.},
