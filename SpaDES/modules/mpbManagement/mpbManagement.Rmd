### `mpbManagement`

We employ a simple module of MPB management based on the detection probability of newly infested pixels.
Our initial explorations (currently in progress) assume new attacks are detected with 60% probability, and infested trees removed with 100% efficacy.
This closely matches the current AB management policy implementation.
We are evaluating the impacts of these two management parameters on MPB spread using several metrics, including changes in spread rates.

Future simulations may examine more direct economic impacts such as volume loss of merchantable timber, and thus be integrated with economic models (modules).
