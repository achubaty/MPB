## Summary

Model red top spread based on availability of pine and distance to beetle sources.

Spread is modeled as an asymmetric percolation process.
Infested pixels disperse "propagules", which follow a dispersal kernel, and settle in pixels based on their proportion pine.
Opitimization approaches, specifically Pattern Oriented Modeling (POM; *e.g.*, Grimm 2005) are used to select the dispersal kernel and its parameters, as well as the parameters associated with asymmetric spreading.
