## Data sources

- Climate projections are in [climate-maps/](https://github.com/achubaty/MPB/tree/master/climate-maps)
- Digital elevation models are in [dem-maps/](https://github.com/achubaty/MPB/tree/master/dem-maps)
- MPB outbreak maps and climate suitability projections are in [mpb-maps/](https://github.com/achubaty/MPB/tree/master/mpb-maps)
- Wind maps have yet to be developed.

## Model development

*in progress*

- The Safranyik *et al.* (1999) model has been ported to GNU Fortran by Bill Riel and Alex Chubaty in the [safranyik-mpb repository](https://github.com/achubaty/safranyik-mpb); elements of which are of interest to the development of this model.
