    abstract = {Canada's National Forest Inventory (NFI) sampling program is designed to support reporting on forests at the national scale. On the other hand, continuous maps of forest attributes are required to support strategic analyses of regional policy and management issues. We have therefore produced maps covering 4.03 × 106 km2 of inventoried forest area for the 2001 base year using standardised observations from the NFI photo plots (PP) as reference data. We used the k nearest neighbours (kNN) method with 26 geospatial data layers including MODIS spectral data and climatic and topographic variables to produce maps of 127 forest attributes at a 250 × 250 m resolution. The stand-level attributes include land cover, structure, and tree species relative abundance. In this article, we report only on total live aboveground tree biomass, with all other attributes covered in the supplementary data (http://nrcresearchpress.com/doi/suppl/10.1139/cjfr-2013-0401). In general, deviations in predicted pixel-level values from those in a PP validation set are greater in mountainous regions and in areas with either low biomass or sparse PP sampling. Predicted pixel-level values are overestimated at small observed values and underestimated at large ones. Accuracy measures are improved through the spatial aggregation of pixels to 1 km2 and beyond. Overall, these new products provide unique baseline information for strategic-level analyses of forests (https://nfi.nfis.org).},

    abstract = {In this study, compatible height and diameter increment models were fitted for lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. var. latifolia Engelm.), trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.), and white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss), using the relationship between diameter and height growth. It was assumed that tree diameter increment is directly proportional to height increment, and the proportionality constant is a function of competition and site productivity. The results showed that the fit statistics are comparable with results of other studies, with adjusted R2 ranging from 30\% to 50\%. A validation test of the models, using independent permanent sample plots data, showed that the short-term predictions of the models for both pure and mixedwood stands are fairly unbiased. The models also gave reasonable average height growth and diameter growth trajectories for pure stands of the three species and also projected long-term mixedwood (aspen – white spruce mixture) volume growth dynamics reasonably well. The models also projected reasonably well (i) the effect of increasing initial stem density on average diameter and height, and (ii) the stand volume compared with an older version the Mixedwood Growth Model (ver. 2000A). It was concluded that explicitly linking tree height and diameter increment models does not only have a solid ecological basis, but it also results in a compatible prediction of tree growth and stand dynamics.},

@article{Yemshanov:2012ea,
    abstract = {Canada's National Forest Inventory (CanFI) provides coarse-grained, aggregated information on a large number of forest attributes. Though reasonably well suited for summary reporting on national forest resources, the coarse spatial nature of this data limits its usefulness in modeling applications that require information on forest composition at finer spatial resolutions. An alternative source of information is the land cover classification produced by the Canadian Forest Service as part of its Earth Observation for Sustainable Development of Forests (EOSD) initiative. This product, which is derived from Landsat satellite imagery, provides relatively high resolution coverage, but only very general information on forest composition (such as conifer, mixedwood, and deciduous). Here we link the CanFI and EOSD products using a spatial randomization technique to distribute the forest composition information in CanFI to the forest cover classes in EOSD. The resultant geospatial coverages provide randomized predictions of forest composition, which incorporate the fine-scale spatial detail of the EOSD product and agree in general terms with the species composition summaries from the original CanFI estimates. We describe the approach and provide illustrative results for selected major commercial tree species in Canada.},
